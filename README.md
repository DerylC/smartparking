## Description

A cost-effective parking solution to address the problems faced by patients/attendants. he solution that we are looking is from a space optimization angle. There is a parking area with limited space. Once a vehicle enters, the system should be able to calculate its space requirement for parking and put it in a
location to get optimal usage.

## Features

## 1. Space Optimization

- **Dynamic Allocation:** Utilizes real-time data to dynamically allocate parking spaces based on demand.
- **Automated Parking Guidance:** Directs drivers to available parking spots, minimizing search time and congestion.

## 2. Cost Efficiency

- **Pricing Models:** Implements flexible pricing models based on factors such as demand, time of day, and special events.
- **Resource Allocation:** Optimizes resource allocation to reduce operational costs and maximize revenue.

## 3. User-Friendly Interface

- **Mobile App Integration:** Allows users to check real-time availability, reserve spots, and make payments through a dedicated mobile app.
- **Notifications:** Sends timely alerts to users regarding parking availability, reservations, and payment reminders.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Congestion:** By guiding drivers to available spots, the system minimizes traffic congestion within the parking facility.

- **Cost Savings:** Optimized space utilization and efficient resource allocation lead to reduced operational costs.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** A user-friendly interface and mobile app integration provide a seamless and convenient parking experience.
